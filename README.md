# Bandcamp Tap

## How do I install these formulae?

Or `brew tap bandcamp/homebrew-tap https://github.ol.epicgames.net/bandcamp/homebrew-tap.git` and then `brew install bandcamp/homebrew-tap/<formula>`.

If you don't have an ssh key for Epic's GHE, you'll be prompted for your Epic GHE: first.lastname/Okta password. 

Set up an SSH key for this repo, it's safer.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
